# Pokédex

This program is a recreation of a Pokédex, where users can get detailed information about different species of Pokémon. Among the features of this app include:

- An intuitive interface that lets users search for the data of a specific Pokémon, where users can learn about different Pokémon and get information such as:
    - Name
    - Type(s)
    - Abilities
    - Cry sound
    - Entry
- A simple quiz where users can try to identify which Pokémon is shown based on its silhouette

In order to design the interfaces, the focus was on applying design heuristics to ensure an attractive interface. Usability reports and think-aloud tests were utilized to identify critical incidents and make necessary corrections for optimal user experience.
